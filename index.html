          Summer (grisma) Comprises Baishakh and Jyaistha (mid-April to mid-June), the two Bangla calendar months, when days are hot and dry. But the influence of summer is usually felt from mid-March. The heat of the sun dries up the waterbodies including the rivers, canals and the wetlands. The summer days are longer than the nights. At this time the southerly or southwesterly monsoons flow over the country. When dry and cool streams of air flowing from the west and northwest come in contact with rain laden clouds, storms occur, which, at times, take a violent form.<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">These storms are popularly known as kalbaishakhi (norâ€™wester) or destructive Baishakh storm.<br>
          The pre-monsoon hot season is characterised by high temperature and occurrence of thunderstorms. April is the hottest month in the country when the mean temperature ranges from 27'C in the east and south to 31'C in the west-central part of the country. After April, increasing cloud-cover dampens temperature. Wind direction is variable in this season, especially during its early part. rainfall accounts for 10 to 25 percent of the annual total, which is caused by thunderstorms.

          The rainy season (barsa) Traditionally spreads over Asadh and Shraban (mid-June to mid-August). However, the rainy season may start from the end of Baishakh and last up to the beginning of Kartik (mid-May to late-October). During the rainy season, the southwest monsoon winds bring plenty of rainfall (70 to 85 percent of the annual total) and occasionally lasting for days without end without any respite. Most of the floodplains of the country remain inundated during this period <span id="dots1">...</span> <span id="more1">. Depending upon the local elevation, the depth and duration of barsha varies in different parts of Bangladesh. For instance, in low lying parts like haors, beels, jheels of Sylhet, Netrokona, Kishoreganj, Gopalganj and Pabna districts inundation lasts for the longest period (more than six months). In other places, like the central parts of Bangladesh, it lasts for about 3 to 4 months. In the rural areas, boat navigation becomes a common mode of transport during this season.<br>
          Plants, half-dead with the summer heat, receive a new lease of life under cool rains and Bangladesh becomes green. Farmers are busy for harvesting jute, in the flood free areas and/or shallowly flooded (0 to 30 cm depth) areas for preparing paddy seedbeds. Barsha is also important for the fishing community of Bangladesh. hilsa fish is available in plenty during this season. The inundated floodplains become a large habitat for a wide variety of aquatic flora and fauna. At this time plenty of edible herbs grow everywhere, as does the national flower lotus. This is the season for keya, kadam, kamini, jui, gandharaj and other fragrant flowers, as well as fruits like guava, pineapple, and pomelo.
